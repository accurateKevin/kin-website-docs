## Installation

Kin SDK for Android is implemented as an Android library. To include the library in your project add these two statements to your `build.gradle` files.

###### Snippet: Modify project build file

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
...
        maven {
            url 'https://jitpack.io'
        }
    }
}
```
###### Snippet: Modify module build files


```gradle
...
dependencies {
    ...

    implementation 'com.github.kinecosystem:kin-sdk-android:<latest release>'
}
```

For the latest release version go to [https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android/releases](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android/releases).

The main repository is at [github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android).


## Overview

Adding Kin features to your Android client requires three steps.

- Accessing the Kin blockchain
- Managing Kin accounts
- Executing transactions against Kin accounts.   

### Accessing the Kin blockchain

Android apps that allow users to earn, spend, and manage Kin are considered clients in the Kin architecture. The following statement creates `kinClient` which includes methods to manage accounts on the Kin blockchain. 


```java
kinClient = new KinClient(context, Environment.TEST, "1acd", "user1")
```

You declare *which* Kin blockchain environment you want to work with using the predefined static variable `Environment.TEST` or  `Environment.PRODUCTION`. 

Each environment variable includes:

- `networkURL` the Kin blockchain node URL
- `networkPassphrase` to access the server

`1acd` in the example is an `appId`, a 4-character string which will be added to each transaction to identify your application. `appId` must contain only digits and upper and/or lower case letters. String length must be exactly 4.

`user1` is the optional string `storeKey` which can be used to create multiple sets of Kin accounts.

### Managing accounts

#### Creating and retrieving a Kin account

The first time you use `KinClient` you need to create a new Kin wallet and an associated Kin account. The Kin wallet is stored on the user's client device and holds a public/private key pair. The private key remains securely stored in the local wallet while the public key will become the address of the Kin account added to the Kin blockchain.
 
Code snippet [Create Kin account](#snippet-create-kin-account) creates a new Kin account if one is not present, while [Retrieve Kin account](#snippet-retrieve-kin-account) retrieves an existing account.

###### Snippet: Create Kin account

```java
KinAccount account;
try {
    if (!kinClient.hasAccount()) {
        account = kinClient.addAccount();
    }
} catch (CreateAccountException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

###### Snippet: Retrieve Kin account

```java
if (kinClient.hasAccount()) {
    account = kinClient.getAccount(0);
}
```

Calling `getAccount` with the existing account index will retrieve the account stored on the device.

```java
kinClient.deleteAccount(int index);
```

**Warning:** You can delete an account from the device using `deleteAccount`, but beware! The account will lose all its existing Kin if you do this.

#### Onboarding

Before a new account can be used it must be added to the blockchain in a process called onboarding. To be of much use the onboarded account will need to receive funds. 

For code details see the [Sample App](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android/tree/dev/sample/)'s [OnBoarding](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/kin/sdk/sample/OnBoarding.java) class.

#### Public Address

Your account can be identified via its public address. To retrieve the account public address use:

```java
account.getPublicAddress();
```

#### Query Account Status

Current account status on the blockchain can be queried using the `getStatus` method which will return one of the following two options:

* `AccountStatus.NOT_CREATED` - Account is not created on the network.
* `AccountStatus.CREATED` - Account was created, account can send and receive Kin.

###### Snippet: Query account status

```java
Request<Integer> statusRequest = account.getStatus();
statusRequest.run(new ResultCallback<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(Integer result) {
        switch (result) {
            case AccountStatus.CREATED:
                //you're good to go!!!
                break;
            case AccountStatus.NOT_CREATED:
                //first create an account on the blockchain.
                break;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception e) {

    }
});
```

The `Request` object in [Query account status](#snippet-query-account-status) creates an asynchronous request with callback. You can also create synchronous requests which will throw exceptions. For details see [Sync vs Async](#sync-vs-async)

#### Retrieving Balance

To retrieve the balance of your account in Kin call the `getBalance` method: 

###### Snippet: Get Kin account balance

```java
Request<Balance> balanceRequest = account.getBalance();
balanceRequest.run(new ResultCallback<Balance>() {

    @Override
    public void onResult(Balance result) {
        Log.d("example", "The balance is: " + result.value(2));
    }

    @Override
        public void onError(Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
});
```

### Transactions

Transactions are executed on the Kin blockchain in a two-step process.

- **Build** the transaction, including calculation of the transaction hash. The hash is used as a transaction ID and is necessary to query the status of the transaction.
- **Send** the transaction to servers for execution on the blockchain.

Snippets [Transfer Kin](#snippet-transfer-kin) and [Whitelist service](#snippet-whitelist-service) illustrate this two-step process.

#### Transferring Kin to another account

To transfer Kin to another account, you need the public address of the account to which you want to transfer Kin.

By default, your user will need to spend Fee to transfer Kin or process any other blockchain transaction. Fee for individual transactions are trivial (1 Fee = 10<sup>-5</sup> Kin).

Some apps can be added to the Kin whitelist, a set of pre-approved apps whose users will not be charged Fee to execute transactions. If your app is in the  whitelist then refer to [transferring Kin to another account using whitelist service](#transferring-kin-to-another-account-using-whitelist-service).

The snippet [Transfer Kin](#snippet-transfer-kin) will transfer 20 Kin to the recipient account "GDIRGGTBE3H4CUIHNIFZGUECGFQ5MBGIZTPWGUHPIEVOOHFHSCAGMEHO".



###### Snippet: Transfer Kin

```java

String toAddress = "GDIRGGTBE3H4CUIHNIFZGUECGFQ5MBGIZTPWGUHPIEVOOHFHSCAGMEHO";
BigDecimal amountInKin = new BigDecimal("20");

// we could use here some custom fee or we can can call the blockchain in order to retrieve
// the current minimum fee by calling kinClient.getMinimumFee() or kinClient.getMinimumFeeSync().
// When you get the minimum fee returned you can start the 'send transaction flow'
// with this fee.(see the sample app).
int fee = 100;

// Build the transaction and get a Request<Transaction> object.
buildTransactionRequest = account.buildTransaction(toAddress, amountInKin, fee);
// Actually run the build transaction code in a background thread and get 
// notified of success/failure methods (which runs on the main thread)
buildTransactionRequest.run(new ResultCallback<TransactionId>() {

    @Override
    public void onResult(Transaction transaction) {
        // Here we got a Transaction object before actually sending the transaction. This means
        // that we can, for example, send the transaction id to our servers or save it locally  
        // in order to use it later. For example if we lose network connectivity just after sending 
        // the transaction then we will not know what happened with this transaction. 
        // So when the network is back we can check the status of this transaction.
        Log.d("example", "The transaction id before sending: " + transaction.getId().id());

        // Create the send transaction request
        sendTransactionRequest = account.sendTransaction(transaction);
        // Actually send the transaction in a background thread.
        sendTransactionRequest.run(new ResultCallback<TransactionId>() {

            @Override
            public void onResult(TransactionId id) {
                Log.d("example", "The transaction id: " + id);
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
});

```
#### Transferring Kin to another account using whitelist service

The flow is very similar to [Transfer Kin](#snippet-transfer-kin) but adds a step in which you:

- Get the 'WhitelistableTransaction' object from the 'Transaction' object you create. 
- Send 'WhitelistableTransaction' to the whitelist service to create string 'whitelistTransaction'.
- Use method 'sendWhitelistTransaction(String whitelist)' where 'String whitelist' = 'whitelistTransaction'.

###### Snippet: Whitelist service

```java
String toAddress = "GDIRGGTBE3H4CUIHNIFZGUECGFQ5MBGIZTPWGUHPIEVOOHFHSCAGMEHO";
BigDecimal amountInKin = new BigDecimal("20");
// because it is white list no fee is needed.
// even if the user enters an amount larger then zero it will not be deducted from her balance.
int fee = 0

buildTransactionRequest = account.buildTransaction(toAddress, amountInKin, fee);
buildTransactionRequest.run(new ResultCallback<TransactionId>() {

    @Override
    public void onResult(Transaction transaction) {
        Log.d("example", "The transaction id before sending: " + transaction.getId().id());

        // depends on your service but you could probably do it this way
        // or give it some listener or some other way.
        String whitelistTransaction = whitelistService.whitelistTransaction(transaction.getWhitelistableTransaction())

        // Create the send the white list transaction request
        sendTransactionRequest = account.sendWhitelistTransaction(whitelistTransaction);
        sendTransactionRequest.run(new ResultCallback<TransactionId>() {

            @Override
            public void onResult(TransactionId id) {
                Log.d("example", "The transaction id: " + id);
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
});

```


#### Memo

Arbitrary data can be added to a transfer operation using the `memo` parameter containing a UTF-8 string up to 21 bytes in length. A typical usage is to include an order number that a service can use to verify payment.

###### Snippet: Add memo to transaction

```java
String memo = "arbitrary data";

buildTransactionRequest = account.buildTransaction(toAddress, amountInKin, fee, memo);
buildTransactionRequest.run(new ResultCallback<TransactionId>() {

    @Override
    public void onResult(Transaction transaction) {
        Log.d("example", "The transaction id before sending: " + transaction.getId.().id());

        sendTransactionRequest = account.sendTransaction(transaction);
        sendTransactionRequest.run(new ResultCallback<TransactionId>() {

            @Override
            public void onResult(TransactionId id) {
                Log.d("example", "The transaction id: " + id);
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    
});
```

## Details

With the basics out of the way, let's look at some details.

### Sync vs Async

Asynchronous requests are supported by our `Request` object. The `request.run()` method will perform requests sequentially on a single background thread and notify success/failure using `ResultCallback` on the Android main thread.
The `cancel(boolean)` method can be used to safely cancel requests and detach callbacks.

A synchronous version (with the 'Sync' suffix) of these methods is also provided. As SDK requests perform network I/O operations, make sure you call synchronous requests in a background thread.

See [Snippet: Query account status](#snippet-query-account-status) for usage.

### Account Listeners

With Kin SDK for Android your service can respond to payments, balance changes and account creation using `BlockchainEvents`. 

###### Snippet: Payment listener

```java
ListenerRegistration listenerRegistration = account
            .addPaymentListener(new EventListener<PaymentInfo>() {
                @Override
                public void onEvent(PaymentInfo payment) {
                    Log.d("example", String
                        .format("payment event, to = %s, from = %s, amount = %s", payment.sourcePublicKey(),
                            payment.destinationPublicKey(), payment.amount().toPlainString());
                }
            });
```

###### Snippet: Balance listener

```java
ListenerRegistration listenerRegistration = account.addBalanceListener(new EventListener<Balance>() {
            @Override
            public void onEvent(Balance balance) {
                Log.d("example", "balance event, new balance is = " + balance.value().toPlainString());
            }
        });
```

###### Snippet: Account creation listener

```java
ListenerRegistration listenerRegistration = account.addAccountCreationListener(new EventListener<Void>() {
            @Override
            public void onEvent(Void result) {
                Log.d("example", "Account has created.");
            }
        });
```

To unregister any listener use the `listenerRegistration.remove()` method.

### Error Handling

`kin-sdk` wraps errors with exceptions. Synchronous methods can throw exceptions and asynchronous requests have `onError(Exception e)` callbacks.

#### Common Errors

`AccountNotFoundException` - Account was not created on the blockchain.  
`InsufficientKinException` - Account has not enough Kin funds to perform the transaction.  
`InsufficientFeeException` - Transaction has not enough Fee to perform the transaction. 

Here's a link to [all exceptions.](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android/tree/master/kin-sdk/src/main/java/kin/sdk/exception/).

### Testing

Both unit tests and instrumented tests are provided. 

Android tests include integration tests that run on a remote test network. Because they are time consuming (depending on network) they are marked as `@LargeTest`.

For a full list of tests see

- https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android/tree/master/kin-sdk/src/test
- https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android/tree/master/kin-sdk/src/androidTest


### Running Tests

For running both unit tests and instrumented tests and generating a code coverage report using Jacoco, use this script
```bash
$ ./run_integ_test.sh
```

Running tests without integration tests

```bash
$ ./gradlew jacocoTestReport  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.notClass=kin.sdk.KinAccountIntegrationTest
```

Generated report can be found at:  
`kin-sdk/build/reports/jacoco/jacocoTestReport/html/index.html`.

### Building from Source

To build from source clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android.git
```
Now you can build the library using gradle, or open the project using Android Studio.

## Sample Code

`Sample` app covers the entire functionality of `kin-sdk`, and serves as a detailed example on how to use the library.

Sample app source code can be found [here](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-android/tree/dev/sample/).
